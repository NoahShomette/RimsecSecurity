[Version 0.1.4]
    
As of now Rimsec Security offers 3 robots, 3 guns, 3 turrets, 1 maintenance station, 1 assembly bench, 1 trade ship (SRS trade ship) and 1 unique component.

The 3 robots are the defender, enforcer and sentinel. The defender is a basic robot that has sufficient skills and power to defend a base and is not recommended for escorting caravans. The enforcer is a more advanced robot that has the sufficient skills and power for a more aggressive doctrine. Lastly, the Sentinel is an advanced heavy robot that is utilised in a supporting role featuring high health, battery capacity and is considered to be quite strong.
All 3 robots come in 4 variants; security, desert, forest, winter with special traits and skill.

The 3 turrets are the LLT, HLT and HAAC. The LLT is a light laser turret that is used in a supportive role firing single shots. The HLT is a heavy laser turret that acts a heavy support emplacement featuring dual cannons for rapid fire. Lastly, the HAAC is a heavy anti armour cannon that is used against armoured targets featuring explosive rounds, it has slow cool down time.

The maintenance station is used as a charging station for robots (not in use and/or are in need of power) it is also used to repair damaged robots.

The assembly bench is used to build robots. It however cannot be built but rather purchased from the SRS trade ship at a hefty price.

The trade ship (SRS trade ship) is where you can acquire robots, assembly bench(es), SRS Processing chips and other vanilla items such as components and chemfuel.

And finally the SRS Processing Unit (unique component) which is a requirement to build SRS Robots and can only be bought!
